 # Hi, I'm Saumita Haldar ðŸ‘‹  
## I'm a credit risk and data professional.

                                                       Welcome to my GitHub profile!

####  I've worked as a Credit Risk Analyst at a bank for almost 6 years, before which I've worked as an Application Support Analyst at an IT services and Consulting company.
